NOTES FOR PROJECT 2
Spent a lot of time on argument parsing and learning how to use C, but a best-effort was made to follow as many best practices
and C conventions as possible.

I attempted the -f option but did not have time to finish implementing it. My attempts inclusion does not seem to affect the
functionality of the other options, but in the event that are issues, I would recommend commenting out the -f option in the
source code.

Feel free to reach out to axq54@case.edu with any questions or concerns.
